      "Chs": "不知道这些特殊的耳廓狐族群如何来到这里，但他们展现出的语言与科技能力远超其他世界中的同类，这使他们拔得头筹，经过我们的估算，这些耳廓狐有能力在200年内探索任何星体。我们将在八个太阳周期内派出一艘船帮助他们，这让我们有时间准备充足的资源与他们交易。但愿他们能够割爱宝贵的超钛矿，它将会为打造方舟Cassini舰队最新的FTL驱动器发挥重大作用。",
      "Eng": "How this particular group of Fenerox came to be here is unknown, but they show a capacity above and beyond their kin found on other worlds for technology and language. This has given them a head-start already, and we estimate they will have reached the stars on their own within 200 years anyhow. We will send a ship to help them along in 8 solar cycles. This should give our traders time to prepare sufficient resources to offer them. Hopefully they will be willing to trade their valuable Tritanium, as it will prove exceptionally valuable in fashioning a new line of FTL drives for Ark Fleet Cassini."

      "Chs": "在参宿七的第三个次等行星上发现了天然的超钛矿脉，这为我们提供了一次跃进的大好机会。对于那些尚未知晓Kirhosian精英的人来说，本次跃进可以帮助我们吸纳这个小种族，并使他们加速与银河社会链接。我们用货物与科技来与他们换取资源以实现双赢，日后，我们将会拥有一个在守护者议会中为我们美言几句的贸易好伙伴，美滋滋。",
      "Eng": "The discovery of this new vein of what appears to be natural tritanium on the third planet of the Rigel Minoris system gives us the perfect chance to attempt an Uplifting. For those among the Kirhosian elite that are not aware, an Uplifting is when we elect to take a minor species and speed up their introduction to the galactic community. We offer them goods and technology in exchange for their resources, and both benefit. As an added bonus, later down the line, we have a valuable new trade partner that may speak on our behalf in the Protectorate Assembly."
